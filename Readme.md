This repo. contains shell scripts I develop over time to run programs hands free and optimized.

Ideas:
------
Shell wrapper that takes files with commands and retry times as arguments and retries the command in case it fails.   
Shell script that runs a job from a given stage and with given dates or try with default values.   
Shell wrapper that runs hands free when retried after a failure.   


Done:
